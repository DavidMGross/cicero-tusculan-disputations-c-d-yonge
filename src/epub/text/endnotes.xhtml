He wrote both comedies and tragedies, of which Cicero (Brutus 18) speaks very contemptuously, as <i xml:lang="la">“Livianæ fabulæ non satis dignæ quæ iterum legantur“</i>—not worth reading a second time.

He was a great musician, and the chief portions of his works which have come down to us are fragments of some musical treatises.</p>
